## 2️⃣ Project Overview

### 🚨 Problem Statement
Urban stray management in Malaysia is often fragmented and slow, leading to:
- Public health risks  
- Animal suffering  
- Lack of automated prioritisation in emergency cases  

### 🌍 SDG Alignment
- **SDG 3 (Target 3.3):** Managing strays prevents the spread of zoonotic diseases (e.g., rabies).  
- **SDG 15 (Target 15.5):** Protecting biodiversity by rescuing domestic strays and preventing ecosystem disruption.  

### 💡 Solution
An AI-powered ecosystem that uses multimodal analysis to:
- Triage rescue requests  
- Coordinate community-led animal welfare  

---

## 3️⃣ Key Features

### 🧠 Multimodal AI Triage
- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to analyze photos and text.
- Ranks emergencies as:
  - Critical
  - Urgent
  - Moderate

### 🗺️ Automatic Safety Protocol
- Geolocates nearby volunteers.
- Routes rescue coordinators efficiently.

### 📍 Real-Time Location Tracking
- Converts GPS coordinates to Malaysian states using Google Geocoding API.

### 🔔 Real-Time Communication
